  <h2>About me</h2>
<p> I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I attended Portland State University and Graduated with a B.S. in History. I have held many jobs including salesmen, project manager, and teacher. After traveling the world I have decided I am ready to move into technology and begin my career as a developer. I am currently enrolled in a web development course while working as an assistant project manager at a commerical engineering firm.</p>

<p>An important part of working in the modern world is familiarty with foreign cultures. as someone who has lived abroad and traveled I think I bring a good perspective on the trials and tribulations of overcoming cultural differences.</p>

<h3>Countries I've visted</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mexico</li>
  <li>Canada</li>
  <li>South Korea</li>
  <li>Japan</li>
  <li>Philippines</li>
  <li>Saipan</li>
  <li>Russia</li>
  <li>Germany</li>
</ul>

<p>Visiting and understanding cultures is one thing. Though it helps if you also can use the language! I have studied a few languages, to varying degrees. Here is the list of languages I have studied in order of my skill level from greatest to least.</p>
